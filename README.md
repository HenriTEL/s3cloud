# s3cloud

A static website that can be hosted on a S3-comatible bucket and used to manage files on this bucket.  
It's based on [shoelace](https://shoelace.style) and [lit](https://lit.dev/).

## Dev Quickstart

You need node and npm (tested with node v16).  
From the root of this repository, run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run a server that updates automatically based on files changes
npm run dev
```
